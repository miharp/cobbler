# How to contribute?

## Code

There is currently no styleguide for writing code but it would be great if we could reduce the number of issues as far
as reasonable and then start to add more features.

## Docs

We are using Sphinx and are publishing the docs to [Readthedocs](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io). The source can be
found in the `docs` folder.

We want to try to use the following rules:

- For first level headings should use `*` over and under the text.
- For second level headings should use `#` under the text.

## Website

The website should contain promotional material and more complex guides. More information about how to contribute there
you can find in the repo for the website: [Github](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler.github.io)

## Issues

- Please include a stacktrace if there is any.
- Please include the log located under `/var/log/cobbler/cobbler.log`.
- Please include steps for reproducing the error, the more precise they are the higher are the chances we can help you.
- Please include the cobbler version you are using!
